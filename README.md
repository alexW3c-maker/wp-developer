## How It Works

The Quick Notes plugin allows users to create, edit, and delete personal notes directly from the WordPress frontend. Once logged in, users can access a simple interface to manage their notes. Each note consists of a title and a body, which can be modified or removed as needed. The plugin uses AJAX for seamless updates without page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
